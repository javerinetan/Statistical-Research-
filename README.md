💯 Distinction

## Project Scope 

<i> ✍️ Project Task </i> 

As a group of innovative, creative and energetic young people (The “ICE” Team) who intend to use data-driven analyses to investigate social issues / support better living in the community. As a team, we had to pick a social topic or a current issue, conjecture a main hypothesis and a set of sub-hypotheses, which will be verified or disproven by the analysis. We have to verify or disprove 1 sub-hypothesis each, which will contribute to verify or disprove the team’s main hypothesis.

<i> 📝 Topic chosen </i>

Is Singapore a good country to live in ?

<i> Why this Topic? </i>

After extensive discussions, we have decided to change our research topic from "Home-Based Learning is a Better Mode of Education than Physical Classrooms" to "Is Singapore a Good Place to Live?" Our initial topic lacked adequate online resources, so we decided to pivot our focus to the quality of life in Singapore, as we realized that we all had both positive and negative perspectives on the matter.

👩 Amber: Healthcare 

👧🏻Javerine: Cost of Living 

## Decision Making for the project: 

🤔 Deciding of sub-topics: 
- Topics were chosen based on individual member's passions
- For me, I felt strongly about the increasing cost of living in Singapore
   - Thus, the topic "The Cost of Living in Singapore is Getting More Expensive" was chosen

😊 Our goal 
- Brainstorm and consult with lecturers(stakeholders) on the feasibility of the project
- Choose a relevant topic
- Enhance knowledge on Statistical Research Methods and Media Literacy
- Research, draw conclusions, and provide recommendations.

📝 Survery
- The aim of the survey was to gather a large, unbiased dataset
- The survey was sent to friends, family and public chatrooms to achieve a diverse range of responses
- The final dataset consisted of 120 valid responses from ages 13 to 60
- Invalid responses, such as those created by jokers, were filtered out.

Due to privicy issues of our respondents, we will not be allowing access to the form responses. 

## Work Process 
📝Creation of the report:
- The team gathered datasets and articles and discussed with each member
- The team reviewed a sample report provided by the lecturer to understand the expected standards
- Based on the review, the team began working on the report.

<p>The Cost of Living in Singapore is Getting More Expensive</p>
📝Introduction 
Singapore is known to be one of the most expensive countries to live in especially in Southeast Asia (SEA). This is because Singapore stands out from the rest of SEA where it is known to be cheap to vacation there. Some reasons why Singapore stands out is due to its size. Singapore is just a tiny red dot on the world map. Due to its size, Singapore lacks natural resources and relies on other countries for resources like food, water, oil and so on. As we rely on the countries for resources we are so bound to face inflation and shaky markets as the supply and demand fluctuate. Through the years the Singapore government has been working hard to keep costs low, by creating or implementing new technology to improve systems to help us grow our own natural resources, filter our water and many more. But is life in Singapore still too expensive and why?


  

## Difficulties 
- The biggest challenge was time management
   - The project timeline was tight, especially with it overlapping the break period where most team members had other commitments
   - The 2-week break period could have been better utilized to conduct the survey and starting our project early 
   - The team ended up working for long hours in the final 4 days before the submission deadline
      - Most members slept only 1-2 hours during this period as they focused on completing the report.
      - This definetly could have been better avoided with better time planning 
      
- Other challenges faced were insufficient datasets and conflicting results from different datasets
   - As I, being new to Statistical Research Methods, sought guidance from the lecturer and utilized online resources to improve their understanding of t-test and shared this knowledge with the team
