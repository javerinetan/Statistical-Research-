## Project Scope 

<i> ✍️ Project Task </i> 

As a group of innovative, creative and energetic young people (The “ICE” Team) who intend to use data-driven analyses to investigate social issues / support better living in the community. As a team, we had to pick a social topic or a current issue, conjecture a main hypothesis and a set of sub-hypotheses, which will be verified or disproven by the analysis. We have to verify or disprove 1 sub-hypothesis each, which will contribute to verify or disprove the team’s main hypothesis.

<i> 📝 Topic chosen </i>

Is Singapore a good country to live in ?

<i> Why this Topic? </i>

After extensive discussions, we have decided to change our research topic from "Home-Based Learning is a Better Mode of Education than Physical Classrooms" to "Is Singapore a Good Place to Live?" Our initial topic lacked adequate online resources, so we decided to pivot our focus to the quality of life in Singapore, as we realized that we all had both positive and negative perspectives on the matter.

## Work Process 

🤔 Deciding of sub-topics: 
- Topics were chosen based on individual member's passions
- For me, I felt strongly about the increasing cost of living in Singapore
   - Thus, the topic "The Cost of Living in Singapore is Getting More Expensive" was chosen

😊 Our goal 
- Brainstorm and consult with lecturers(stakeholders) on the feasibility of the project
- Choose a relevant topic
- Enhance knowledge on Statistical Research Methods and Media Literacy
- Research, draw conclusions, and provide recommendations.

📝 Survery
- The aim of the survey was to gather a large, unbiased dataset
- The survey was sent to friends, family and public chatrooms to achieve a diverse range of responses
- The final dataset consisted of 120 valid responses from ages 13 to 60
- Invalid responses, such as those created by jokers, were filtered out.

Due to privicy issues of our respondents, we will not be allowing access to the form responses. 

🤝Helping members
- During this project we faced many issues like, datasets were insufficient. Calculations and hypothesis proven different from different dataset. 
- Although, I was still new to Statistical Research Methods, I constantly communicate with my lecture for advice on the calculations and watched videos online, to help me better understand how to use t-test, which I later shared with my members to help them with. 

😖 Difficulties
The biggest difficulty my members and I faced was time management. The project timeline was already very short, especially with this overlapping into our break, where most of us were busy and did not use our time to good use to use the 2 weeks of break, to conduct the survey.
