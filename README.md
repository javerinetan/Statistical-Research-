💯 Distinction

## Project Scope 

<i> ✍️ Project Task </i> 

As a group of innovative, creative and energetic young people (The “ICE” Team) who intend to use data-driven analyses to investigate social issues / support better living in the community. As a team, we had to pick a social topic or a current issue, conjecture a main hypothesis and a set of sub-hypotheses, which will be verified or disproven by the analysis. We have to verify or disprove 1 sub-hypothesis each, which will contribute to verify or disprove the team’s main hypothesis.

<i> 📝 Topic chosen </i>

Is Singapore a good country to live in ?

<i> Why this Topic? </i>

After extensive discussions, we have decided to change our research topic from "Home-Based Learning is a Better Mode of Education than Physical Classrooms" to "Is Singapore a Good Place to Live?" Our initial topic lacked adequate online resources, so we decided to pivot our focus to the quality of life in Singapore, as we realized that we all had both positive and negative perspectives on the matter.

👨‍Jonathan: Saftey

👱Dylan: Mental Health

👩 Amber: Healthcare 

👧🏻Javerine: Cost of Living 

## Decision Making for the project: 

🤔 Deciding of sub-topics: 
- Topics were chosen based on individual member's passions
- For me, I felt strongly about the increasing cost of living in Singapore
   - Thus, the topic "The Cost of Living in Singapore is Getting More Expensive" was chosen

😊 Our goal 
- Brainstorm and consult with lecturers(stakeholders) on the feasibility of the project
- Choose a relevant topic
- Enhance knowledge on Statistical Research Methods and Media Literacy
- Research, draw conclusions, and provide recommendations.

📝 Survery
- The aim of the survey was to gather a large, unbiased dataset
- The survey was sent to friends, family and public chatrooms to achieve a diverse range of responses
- The final dataset consisted of 120 valid responses from ages 13 to 60
- Invalid responses, such as those created by jokers, were filtered out.

Due to privicy issues of our respondents, we will not be allowing access to the form responses. 

## Work Process 
📝Creation of the report:
- The team gathered datasets and articles and discussed with each member
- The team reviewed a sample report provided by the lecturer to understand the expected standards
- Based on the review, the team began working on the report.

📝Documentation: 
I started with introducing why Singapore is expensive with articles I have read and why the hypothesis "The Cost of Living in Singapore is Getting More Expensive"
Followed by that, I explain about the methodology, I had use on my secondary data and what the data purpose in this to prove my hypthesis. I then selected a few subtopics to cover on: Singapore Food Prices,Cost of Housing . I choose these two topics as base on the survey my team conducted, we found that majority of Singaporeans found these to be their concerns in cost of living in Singapore. I used linear regression to get the Linear model data on excel from the datasets I had retrieved from data.gov.sg and many other repuitable website. 

To help with my conculsion, I did a Data Analysis to test the hypothesis. Using Z-Test (Two Sample for Means), I calculated the results of Singapore Vs Globalon the mean, and teh confidence interval. Base on my results recieved from the caluclation, I am 95% confident that the mean of the inflation rate in Singapore over the years is between 1.061 and 2.247, and that the mean of global inflation rate over the years is between 4.686 and 6.891. Hence, the global inflation rate over the years is higher than the inflation rate in Singapore over the years

📝 Conclusion for my hypothesis
In conclusion, our statistical testing is unable to support the claim that “The Cost of Living in Singapore is Getting More Expensive”, even though the majority of us are already experiencing an increase in prices in our daily lives. It is only able to give evidence that the inflation rate is increasing in Singapore.However, the claim “The Cost of Living in Singapore is Getting More Expensive” could still be true, as due to limited time and resources, we were only able to do one hypothesis testing, through the inflation in Singapore as compared to other countries. If we had more time, we could look at more aspects like the country's gross domestic product (GDP) , Inflation consumer price index(2019=100) ,the income group gap comparing how much price increases for each and how it affects them etc.

## Difficulties 
- The biggest challenge was time management
   - The project timeline was tight, especially with it overlapping the break period where most team members had other commitments
   - The 2-week break period could have been better utilized to conduct the survey and starting our project early 
   - The team ended up working for long hours in the final 4 days before the submission deadline
      - Most members slept only 1-2 hours during this period as they focused on completing the report.
      - This definetly could have been better avoided with better time planning 
      
- Other challenges faced were insufficient datasets and conflicting results from different datasets
   - As I, being new to Statistical Research Methods, sought guidance from the lecturer and utilized online resources to improve their understanding of t-test and shared this knowledge with the team
