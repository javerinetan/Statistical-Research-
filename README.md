## Project Scope 

<i> ✍️ Project Task </i> 

As a group of innovative, creative and energetic young people (The “ICE” Team) who intend to use data-driven analyses to investigate social issues / support better living in the community. As a team, we had to pick a social topic or a current issue, conjecture a main hypothesis and a set of sub-hypotheses, which will be verified or disproven by the analysis. We have to verify or disprove 1 sub-hypothesis each, which will contribute to verify or disprove the team’s main hypothesis.

<i> 📝 Topic chosen </i>

Is Singapore a good country to live in ?
